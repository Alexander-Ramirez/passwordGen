Things I did
1) added Develop file from the hw so it could be here
2) added things from the zoom recording as a base start
3) added more let variables for the password generator
4) added the prompts that lets people pick the things that they want
5) created the if statements and added to arrays
6) made the for loop and tried to make it work
